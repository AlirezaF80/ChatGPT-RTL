# LLM RTL

LLM RTL is a UserScript which modifies the chat interface of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT to fix the direction of RTL (right-to-left) languages, such as Persian, Hebrew, and Arabic.

## Installation

1. Install a UserScript manager extension for your browser. (Example: Tampermonkey, Greasemonkey)
2. [Click here to install the LLM RTL UserScript](https://github.com/AlirezaF80/ChatGPT-RTL/raw/main/LLM-RTL.user.js).
   - If the installation doesn't start automatically, you can right-click the link, select "Save Link As...", and save the file with a `.user.js` extension.
3. Follow the instructions provided by your UserScript manager to install the UserScript.

## Usage

Once the UserScript is installed, it will automatically run on websites hosting LLM interfaces, such as the [ChatGPT website](https://chatgpt.com). It will detect RTL text and modify the corresponding elements to display the text correctly from right to left.

## Supported Sites

- [ChatGPT (OpenAI)](https://chatgpt.com)
